# GCSF Lean

A Lean formalization project accompanying the General Central Singularity
Formula (GCSF), focusing on the structural setup and definitions around
central singular behavior of L-functions.

This repository does not claim a full formal proof of the General Central
Singularity Formula.

Instead, it provides a Lean formalization of the structural definitions and
foundational framework introduced in the paper, intended as a
verification-oriented companion and a step toward future formal development.
